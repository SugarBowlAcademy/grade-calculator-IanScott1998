<!--
Today you will be making an webpage that asks the user a few
questions and then does something based on those responses
first you need be able to run your code in a browser, so go to
packages, settings view, install packages, and search for "run in browser"
Install that package.
Next you need to be able to run javascript in HTML.

Make sure this file is saved .html then create the regular html structure
using html *tab*
javascript goes in the body, so use the <script></script> element.
From here you will be using a couple different tools to interact with the
user
1. first lets use the simplest command, alert()

try this in <script>
alert("I have a few questions for you")

alert might be useful sometimes because it pauses what is happening on the webpage.

2. let's try to use the prompt() command. put this inside of <script>

var name = prompt("What is your name");

What does this do?

2. now, using the variable name, have it print

console.log("Welcome to my awesome website " + name)

Where does this print?


3. now let's try confirm(), try this line

var sugarLoaf=confirm("Do you go to Sugar Loaf Academy?")

save your document and run it in a broswer, then check the JS console.

What happens if you click okay? what happens if you click cancel?

4. I want you to create an if else statement based on peoples name and
some other trait. You can see below what I have done. You want it to use
the name but print different things if the person responds differently.

5. for loops. before your next html hangman project
  I want you to make a loop that checks if a letter that the user inputs matches
  a letter of a word

6. while loops. a while loop is something that will happen while something is true
we can make our question a while loop that won't stop until you
answer it a certain way. for example we could ask "do you love coding" and we
could say while the answer to that is false or no, keep asking the question.
let's try it below
inside of <script></script> paste the following code

sugarLoaf=null;
while(sugarLoaf!="yes"){
  var sugarLoaf=prompt("Do you love coding?")}

save the doc and use control-option-Q to run the code
