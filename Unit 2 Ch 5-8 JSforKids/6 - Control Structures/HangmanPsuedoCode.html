<!-- The big game. Now that you have some tools you are going to use
them to take the hangman game and turn it into a website. It will be
necessary for you to go back to the hangman.js file that you
commented on before to make this new game. Follow the instructions but use
the hangman.js file as a guide for how to do things.

These are your goals for today:
1. Make a variable that asks the user for what word they want to guess, store the word
2. make an empty array that is as long as the word but is filled with " - " instead
3. make a while loop that continues while the users word does not equal the guessed word


The structure of the game
1. Pick a random word from an array of words you choose
2. make a blank word made of hyphens that represents what the player has guessed

3. While the word has not been guessed {
Show the player their current progress
Get a guess from the player

4. If the player wants to quit the game {
Quit the game
}


5. Else {
If the guess is in the word {
Update the player's progress with the guess
}
}
}
6. Congratulate the player on guessing the word
