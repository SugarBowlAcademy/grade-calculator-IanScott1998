Here you can start to see nesting. html opens and closes
the document. the first thing inside of the html element is the head element.
1. What element(s) are in the head element?

2. What is at the same level as the head element?

3. What is inside the body element?


4. let's add a link, this is an anchor. Copy and paste this into <p>. This is an inline link

<a href="http://honestslogans.com/"> this is the part that is highlighted</a>This part is not highlighted

5. Now let's add a title inside the anchor element like this <a href=""  title="Honest Slogans" ></a>. Now if you ghover over the link it should display the title
