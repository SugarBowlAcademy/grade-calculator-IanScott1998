/*
We have gone through 4 chapter but we need to review to really understand
what we have done. We have covered

Data types
arrays
variables
operators - both logical and for variable manipulation
String functions(pop,push,shift,unshift)
indexing
functions
objects

Vocab list:Key, value, index, console, command line, output, variable, script, environment, logical, elements, nested

*/
//We have not really looked at incrementing and decrementing

//initialize an integer of any value
var int=10

//now initialize that code in the console and let's play with it
/*
use each of the following operators to change the value of int

Incrementing and decrementing
	++ adds one to a variable
	-- subtracts one from a variable
	+= adds the specified amount to a variable
	-= subtracts a specified amount
	*= multiplies a variable by the given amount
	/= divides by the given amount
*/

//Practice each of the concepts listed at the beginning of this document below

//create a variable that is a String, one that is a boolean value, and one that is an integer. Write your answer below
var kayak = "zen"
var weekendKayak = true;
var number = 7;

//create an array of the variables you just created
var list=[kayak,weekendKayak,number]
//write a logical statement that evaluates to TRUE, then write one that evaluates to FALSE. Use all of the logical operators in these statements

//make an array with a list of strings that is at least 4 elements long


//write commands that would remove the last element of the list you just created, remove the first element, add an element to the end, add an element to the beginning, splice out 1 element from the 2nd position of the list and add a string in it's place
