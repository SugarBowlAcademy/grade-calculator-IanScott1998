Your final project is to make a game about the middle lunch economy. You know how there were people who had awesome lunches like Lunchables and mini candy bars and people who had terrible lunches like dry brocolli and nuts, then there insued a lot of negotiating for better lunchs? That is what this game is about. In this game, you start with three items for lunch, put in order of desirability. Then you create friends who also have lunches that have three items in order of desirability. Your goal is to write a game where four friends trade lunches. Here are instructions for making the game.

8/9th graders
First Grab the file called LunchTimeNegotiation8thGrade

1. Create four objects, your friends, that each have key:value pair of lunch:lunch list.
2. Then you have to create a function that takes a friend as an argument
3. Within that function you have to write an if-then statement where 50% of the time you win the trade and 50% of the time you lose. You will do this useing the Math.random() function as the argument in the if () statements
4. If you win(i.e. math.Random>50%) then you give away the last item on your list using .pop() and the friend gives away their first item with .unshift(). store these variables
5. Then you get your friends first item .shift() onto your lunch list. and he gets yours add onto the end of his list with .push()
6. Vice versa if you lose, he gets your first and you get is last.
7. finally at the end of the trade() funtion you will console.log() what happened. For example it will say "You won the trade with your friend and got his Cookies and he got your broccoli"
8. You win the game when you have all of lunch items you want

//10th grade and up
//make your objects here
var = {}


//make your function here, it takes an object as an argument
var = function(){


//start your if else statement here
if(//use Math.Random here){
  //what happens if you win
}else{
  //what happens if you lose
}

//12th graders have to add addition functionality to the program. this needs to be decided on by the student and approved by the teacher. You can keep track of how many tries it takes you to win, you could increase the negotiators skill as they negotiate more and more, you could randomly add in bonuses into the game, like "Surprise, during the negotiation you found a quarter and bought a lollipop" and a lollipop is added to your
